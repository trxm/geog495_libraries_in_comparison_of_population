# Libraries in Washington School Districts

## Description
A simple map where you search for specific cities and look at the libraries in defined school districts.

The main goal of this map is to show all the libraries in Washington State and where they are mainly concentrated. I wanted to see if there were any correlations between cities, school districts and the amount of libraries. I believe that having public access to libraries is extremely beneficials to the general population, especially young children or students. Therefore, I wanted to see the relationships between cities/school districts and concentration of libraries. Data for public school is also added to compare proximity between the schools and the libraries.
